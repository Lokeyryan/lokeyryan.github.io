    Thoughts & Prayers
    <br><br>
    <pre>
“Attention. Attention. We are entering lockdown.”
Pencils clatter against desks and the
sounds of sighs infuse the room as
a pleasant robotic voice over the P.A.
calmly warns me and my classmates
that there is an active shooter
in the building.

It’s just a drill, of course.
But these are the kinds of drills
we need in the good ol’ U.S.,
where kids are killed in schools
on most days of the week.
It’s nothing new.

I barricade us in
(as well as I can
with a tiny metal door stopper, anyway)
and turn off the lights,
because that’ll save us.
Then I shuffle
to the front of the room,
away from the interior windows.
We’re all familiar with this by now.
So I and lower myself to the floor and wonder,
    </pre>
    <pre style="font-style: italic;">
Why is this still an issue?
    </pre>
    <pre>
Britain
swiftly banned rifles—
and almost all other guns—
after a 1987 massacre
that killed 16.

Australia
established sweeping buybacks
and tightened gun-ownership licensing
after a 1996 mass shooting
that left 35 dead.

Well, in the land of the free,
13 were murdered
at Columbine High School in 1999.
26 people were brutally killed
at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012.
21 took their final breath
in Uvalde’s Robb Elementary School in 2022.

And yet,
kids’ lives are still
severed short.
Politicians stall,
focusing on the “bigger issues,”
while American patriots
laze on their couches,
content to turn down the volume on the news
or send their heartfelt thoughts and prayers out to the victims’ families
until screams fill their son’s or daughter’s
elementary school hallways.

I sit in silence like I’m supposed to,
staring aimlessly at my shoes and
waiting for the P.A. system
to release me.
By now,
it seems we should realize
that thoughts and prayers
aren’t enough.
